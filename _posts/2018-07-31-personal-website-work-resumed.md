Today, I finally got around to resuming work on my personal website! I began the project at the beginning of summer and just got back around to it. The initial template can be found here [Blog Demo](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/). The website is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), the engine behind [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

I wasn't going to initially include the blog portion, but figured it couldn't hurt! I added image references to my social media and spent time understanding each component of the website I wrote. Stay tuned for my work!

In addition, I wanted to add in the commandline to my [shortcut menu](https://www.windowscentral.com/add-open-command-window-here-back-context-menu-windows-10).. there are issues though since a windows 10 creator update replaced command line with power shell and I don't need that much power!
