title: "Motivating interview experience!"

I spent the entirety of the previous night trying to create a simple Java CRUD application with a database without the use of a main method and ran into many bugs, issues, and other problems from not having the technologies set up before hand. 
Java Spring was a pain for me to deal with as I didn't understand the file directory and where everything went. I must've made at least three spring projects using start.spring.io before I changed over to using JDBC(Java Database Connectivity) and I didn't find out about it until 2 hours prior to the interview!
I was caught by surprise when the interview wasn't behavioural and technical questions were asked. For my first interview, it went well in my opinion and I gained a lot of experience also understanding as to how companies that use agile operate.

How was this interview motivating? It ignited a drive in me to be able to explain everything I do with proper terminology and in layman's terms. For day 4/100DaysOfCode, I used html as a practice to make sure I learn and know the proper terminology associated with it.
