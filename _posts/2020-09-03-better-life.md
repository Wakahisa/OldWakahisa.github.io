It has been two years since my previous post. Can't really call this a blog can I?
I have learned so much over these past two years and grown a lot as a person & professional. You
really do learn the most from failures as opposed to victories. The tangible things that you aren't 
aware of until you have truly experienced them yourself. Reading about the event isn't the same as 
having lived it. This goes back to the argument of theory vs practice.

What is this post really about? Well. I suppose a way for me to explicitly work on actionable steps
toward the future I want for myself. 

Last month, I spent a large amount of time learning about forex, stocks, and investing. I have tried my hand
at paper trading and have been relatively successful at my speculations. Now the question is, will I have the
same success in real trading where the trades are not instanteous? My orders will not be filled? What an exciting
unpredictable direction I am heading in! With practice, my writing will improve and these pieces won't be so dry.
