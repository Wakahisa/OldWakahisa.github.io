You know what, I'm just going to ramble on about some thoughts and views I use to have in the past. When I was in kindergarten, I won a number of awards and cheered happily about my accomplishments. I don't remember what all the
rewards were for, but I felt great getting them at the time. I remember Miss Vanhaggle, my kindergarten teacher, giving an award to another student and no one shared in mine nor their enthusiasm. At this time, I had not learned how to 
be humble and not to gloat yet. In hindsight, I should've accepted my awards graciously and took into consideration the feelings of my classmates. It probably wasn't a big deal then and now it certainly isn't, but who is to say right?

Let's skip forward to first grade with Mrs. Hansen. We took a vocab test that I didn't take seriously and regretted for awhile, but I didn't speak up about not having reached my capacity and that it was a serious endeavor. I can without a doubt
and confidently say, I know more than 35 words at this time! The objective was to write down as many words as we knew, but I was leisurely just goofing off while doing it. Other than that class event, I remember seeing a tuxedo that my mom had bought
for me, but I never ended up wearing.. I bragged to the girls about it and somehow during recess, they all ended up chasing me for whatever reason. I felt so cool up until... I tripped and hurt my knee. I had to go get a bandage for my boo-boo. After that,
no one paid me anymore attention. What a thrill that all was though haha.

We've forgotten about my first grade blunders right? Following the script, it's time for second grade with Mrs. Demars! One time during recess, I coordinated kickball with my class without knowing the proper rules. Essentially what happened was, it was me and one other
kid on one team as the pitcher and catcher while everyone else was kicking. As with our ignorant hyjinks, what ended up happening during our game was this. When I pitched the ball, a student would kick it and the my team would catch the ball or it would bounce and once we got a hold of it
the other team's kicker would be out. The noon duty noticed we were playing incorrectly and then proceeded to teach us all the proper ways of kickball. And so ended my tyranny of one-sided kickball.
