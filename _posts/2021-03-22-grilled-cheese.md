I spent the past week watching videos related to cooking and Gordon Ramsey. Aside from the eye candy or questionable meals produced by chefs, I have learned a number of colorful compliments from Ramsey.
Rest assured, I won't be calling people donuts or donkeys in my professional or personal life. Maybe during a match of League of Legends, but highly unlikely. All of this cooking and insulting lead me onto a mission of my own.
I wanted to perfect a basic grilled cheese sandwich! Now we can argue what makes a grilled cheese sandwich and what makes a melt. I'm going to take the purest route and stick to these ingredients: cheese, butter, and bread.

I haven't been this excited for anything in ages. This trip to the grocery store felt more special than others as I gathered my ingredients. I opted to go for potato bread, american cheese, pepper jack cheese, and unsalted butter.
The trick I learned to use is butter the outer loaves of the bread then grill each side for up to three minutes. My butter wasn't cooperating, so I decided to melt it down and plop my bread into it until it was crispy.
I layered my cheese and other slice of bread onto the grilled one. Flipping it to complete the rest of the cooking process, my creation was completed! I wasn't sure how it would taste. My first bite was decculent and I felt so proud!
Yes.. proud at producing a satisfactory grilled cheese sandwich. I have to try other cheeses, breads, and butters to see what makes for the most scumptious combo. I should try my hand at making a tomato soup as well to accompany.

During my grocery trip, I came upon an interesting combo of ice cream. The flavor is called Unicorn Swirl, it was cake batter with animal cracker frosted in icing. My initial spoonful was delicious and after that, the contents of the ice cream
felt too sugary to me. I couldn't taste the animal cracker at all and only tasted the icing. I won't be buying a second container of this in the future.
