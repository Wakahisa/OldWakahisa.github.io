I have been hiding from the outside world for some time now. The idea of being seen in public makes me anxious. For what reason? I am not presenting my best self to the world. I have been way too concerned with how I will be perceived and have lost my unique sense of confidence.
The things that only I would notice and judge myself for, I end up thinking others would see those same flaws and be harsh about them. In retrospect, this shouldn't cause me harm in any way, but your mind can be cruel at times. I would love to return to an environment where I can produce good in the world, but I am worried about whether or not
I still have what it takes to be a good teammate and productive worker. The standards I believe I should have, but do not embody anymore eat away at me. Were all those hours and years I spent on myself for nothing? I want to be back in a positive feedback loop as opposed to a negative one. I want to be conscious of my actions instead of reacting to bad habits.
This will all take effort and time. It will be worth it during the journey and at the end.

Maybe my biggest concern isn't whether to prove to an employer that I am worth the chance to take on, but to prove to myself that I am. I can't recall that my performance has been questioned; I preemptively assume that I am doing poorly and then have that mental affliction daunting on my mind. It is good to be kind to yourself.
My recent failures have taken me by storm and taught me that things won't always run smoothly. Some things you have to remove your personal feelings and expectations from. The environment around is an acclimation of what has happened before without your presence and may as well remain the same. I want to be fulfilled in life and I want to keep trying until I am satisfied.
I may be setback, but that doesn't mean I'll stay put and remain in an unhappy state.
