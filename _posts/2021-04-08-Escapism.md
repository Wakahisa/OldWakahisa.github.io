I am clearly addicted to League of Legends and have been using it as an escapism to not face problems I felt have grown out of hand. The comfort of playing a game that I understand inside and out that doesn't even bring me joy most of the time anymore due to my declining hardware. I am literally ruining my own experience by not buying a new computer using the excuse that it can do other things on it just fine. Maybe I subconsciously liked using it as an excuse for why certain outcomes happen in the game. ANYWAYS, I really really want to move forward in life and do things that will contribute to my well being. I want feel good about myself. I want to like how I look. I want to feel proud about myself. I want so much. So much more out of life.
